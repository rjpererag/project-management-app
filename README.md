# Fast API and MongoDB use case: Project management web app

## Description
I want to create a REST API demonstration using FastAPI as a web framework, this API will work as the backbone of a project management application with basic CRUD operations against the projects, tasks and members collections in order to create, track and any other managerial operation.

## Goals
 - Design a REST API using FastAPI to handle authentication, and CRUD operations.
 - Create a MongoDB as database for backend purposes
 - Create a basic frontend to interact with the project management application

## Technology stack
- **FastAPI**: web framework for REST API design.
- **Docker**: containerization service
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database to store collections
